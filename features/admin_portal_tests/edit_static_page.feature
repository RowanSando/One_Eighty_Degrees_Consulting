  As an admin, 
  I want to be able to edit static page content (like the home page, about page, and team page), 
  so I can change our website's content to match how our group changes.

#   Background:
#     Given the following users exist:
#     | email                       | password    | member_type |
#     | admin@berkeley.edu          | password123 | admin       |
#     | admin1@berkeley.edu         | password123 | admin       |
#     | applicant@berkeley.edu      | password123 | applicant   |  
  
#   Scenario: an admin can edit the home page
#     Given I am on the home page
#     When I follow "Login"
#     And I fill in "Email" with "admin@berkeley.edu"
#     And I fill in "Password" with "password123"
#     And I press "Log in"
#     And I follow "Admin"
    
#     And I follow "Edit Home Page"
#     And I fill in "Edit Mission Statement" with "We are a consulting club!"
#     And I press "Update"
#     And I follow "Home"
#     Then I should see "We are a consulting club!"
